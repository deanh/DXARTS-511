    <h1>Visualization of Digital Asset Consumption Data with HTML5 and Other Web Technologies</h1>
    <h2>DXARTS 511: Fall 2010, Dean Hudson</h2>
    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
    <h4>Project Goals and Justification</h4>
    <p>The primary purpose of this project was to generate a toolset for and a deeper understanding of a process for web based data visulizations using the Canvas API from HTML5. Corollary to that, it was important to use a large real world data set, since my main motivation for studying data visualization techniques is to make large data sets tractable.</p>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>To this purpose, I used a large data set provided by my employer, Sub Pop Records. The data came from two disparate sources and provided record of individual media downloads from subpop.com over the period from 2001 to present. Records from 2001 to 2006 (~40 million rows) were kept in a MySQL database along with the other data from the old version subpop.com. Newer records were kept in web access logs from S3 (<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com">s3.amazonaws.com</a>), the hosting provider from which the media was delivered. This second data set consists of about 7 million rows.</p>
    <p>In order to be usable, the data needed to be normalized into a common format which could used easily from Javascript in the visualization. The final JSON formats are described in the <a href="html/data_formats.html">data formats</a> section. The data underwent extensive processing before reaching its current form:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Referrer data was santized and separated into host data and IP data when available.</li>
      <li>IP addresses were looked up via a custom geo location library based on HostIP.info data.</li>
      <li>The asset metadata was looked up in both the legacy subpop.com database (for the older records), and the newer subpop.com metadata for S3 records.</li>
      <li>The normalized record was writen to a text JSON file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The primary work was done in Ruby via two scripts: <a href="../bin/s3_downloads_to_json.rb">s3_downloads_to_json.rb</a> and <a href="../bin/ogami_downloads_to_json.rb"> ogami_downloads_to_json.rb</a> called by a wrapper shell script (<a href="../bin/process_s3_logs.sh">process_s3_logs.sh</a>). The data was further reduced by a series of shell and ruby techniques into summary form.</p>
    <p>Once the data was normalized it is pulled into an HTML5 client via a webserver. The HTML5 client was uses Javascript library which wraps the Canvas API which I wrote called <a href="js/dlib.js">dLIb</a>. Using this library, a secondary library which I wrote to make pulling the data out of the JSON structures easier (<a href="js/download.js">download.js</a>), and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery 1.4</a> the data is then rendered into an interactive visual in the browser.</p>

    <h4>Issues</h4>
    <p>My initial plan was to use CouchDB as an interactive data store which would allow me to query and summarize the data. Couch seemed to be a good fit for this project; it stores data natively as JSON documents and serves them directly over HTTP, which would make the delivery via Ajax requests straight forward. However, I ran into significant performance issuses with CouchDB inserts and view generation. I was only able to load a subset of the S3 data (~4 million rows) into my local Couch server, and this took several tries and several days worth of processing. I reworked my data loading code until I was able to make it about twice as fast as my first pass, but the performance was still unacceptable for the larger data set. On top of that, my initial view generation (the reduction into summary data of the larger data set by CouchDB) took almost a day--since I needed to try several different views, this became impractical.</p>
    <p>To get around these issues, I used Unix shell tools (cut, awk, grep, xargs, and perl) to generate summary JSON text files from the S3 data which I serve statically. This has the disadvantage of not being able to handle dynamic requests, but allowed me to move forward with the client-side work.</p>
    <p>Other issues of note:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Browser compatibility: since my end project uses the HTML5 Canvas element extensively, it only renders in browsers which support this element. According to Wikipedia, this includes newer versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera. IE support does not exist prior to IE9, although earlier versions can by suplimented with Javascript or Flash for compatability (Canvas).</li>
      <li>Similarly, since the entire visualization is written in Javascript, it will not work in browsers that have Javascript disabled.</li>
      <li>Accessibility: the data is pulled in via Ajax and summarized in Javascript; although the summary JSON documents could be pulled directly and read, it is rendered via the Canvas element and thus unavailable to screen readers. In fact, the text in this project could have been rendered in a more accessable way--the visual effects could have been rendered in a more accessible way via DOM scripting. However, exploring the Canvas API was a primary goal of this project.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Visulization and Results</h4>
    <p>Using the above tools, I was able to generate a visualization that follows subpop.com MP3 downloads on a daily basis from 2010/06/19 to 2010/10/13. The visualization groups downloads of a particular file based on the territory in which it was downloaded based on color. The size of the text is indicitive of the total number of downloads of a particular file in a region, with larger numbers of downloads rendered as larger text. The text is sized in relation to the square root of the number of downloads in order provide more visually appropriate relative sizing between the different downloads.</p>
    <p>The numbers in the bottom left corner indicate the sum totals of downloads per region, and are color coded to match the text of the individual track downloads within that region. This text is also sized relative to the square root of the number of downloads, to help visually indicate the magnitude of the day's downloads</p>
    <p>The animation is not fully interactive, but the pace of the animation is controllable via the "S" and "F" keys ("S" for "slower," "F" for "faster"). The direction of the animation can be controlled as well with the arrow keys, and it can be paused with the SPACE key.</p>
