    <h1>Visualization of Digital Asset Consumption Data with HTML5 and Other Web Technologies</h1>
    <h2>DXARTS 511: Fall 2010, Dean Hudson</h2>
    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
    <h4>Project Goals and Justification</h4>
    <p>The primary purpose of this project was to generate a toolset for and process for web based data visualizations using the Canvas API from HTML5. A secondary goal was to a large real world data set.</p>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>To these ends, I used data provided by Sub Pop Records. The data came from two disparate sources and provided record of individual resource downloads from subpop.com over the period from 2001 to present. Records from 2001 to 2006 (~40 million rows) were kept in a MySQL database along with the other data from the old version subpop.com. Newer records were kept in web access logs from S3 (<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com">s3.amazonaws.com</a>), and consisted of about 7 million rows.</p>
    <p>In order to be usable, the data needed to be normalized into a common format which could made available to the Javascript in the visualization. JSON was selected as the data format due to its ease of use within Javascript. The final JSON formats are described in the <a href="data_formats.html">data formats</a> section. The data underwent extensive pre-processing in order to generate accurate data which was properly formatted in the described format:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Referrer data was sanitized and separated into host data and IP data when available.</li>
      <li>IP addresses were mapped to country, city, and geo coordinates via a custom geolocation database and ruby library based on HostIP.info data.</li>
      <li>Accurate asset metadata (title, artist, and release) was pulled from both a legacy subpop.com database (2001-2006 data), and the newer subpop.com metadata for S3 records.</li>
      <li>The normalized record was then written to a text JSON file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The primary work was done in Ruby via two scripts: <a href="../bin/s3_downloads_to_json.rb">s3_downloads_to_json.rb</a> and <a href="../bin/ogami_downloads_to_json.rb"> ogami_downloads_to_json.rb</a> called by a wrapper shell script (<a href="../bin/process_s3_logs.sh">process_s3_logs.sh</a>). The data was further reduced by a series of shell and ruby techniques into summary form.</p>
    <p>The normalized data is pulled into an HTML5 client which renders the visualization in the browser. The HTML5 client is almost entirely Javascript; it uses a simple animation library that I wrote which wraps the Canvas API called <a href="js/dlib.js">dLib</a>. In addtion, there is a second library (<a href="js/downloads.js">downloads.js</a>) which is used to make pulling the data out of the JSON structures easier. Lastly, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery 1.4</a> is used for event management, Ajax support, and DOM manipulation. Using these tools, the data is rendered into an interactive visual in the browser.</p>

    <h4>Issues</h4>
    <p>My initial plan was to use CouchDB as an interactive data store which would allow me to query and summarize the data. Couch seemed to be a good fit for this project; it stores data natively as JSON documents and serves them directly over HTTP, which would make data acquisition via Ajax request straight forward. However, I ran into significant performance issues with CouchDB inserts and view generation. I was only able to load a subset of the S3 data (~4 million rows) into my local Couch server, and this took several tries and several days worth of processing. I reworked my data loading code significantly after my first pass; after significant optimization, I was able to make the code run about twice as fast, but this was still unacceptable performance for working on the larger data set. In addition, my initial view generation (the reduction into summary data of the larger data set by CouchDB) took almost a day--since I needed to try several different views, this quickly became impractical.</p>
    <p>To get around these issues, I used Unix shell tools (cut, awk, grep, xargs, and perl) to generate JSON text files from the S3 data which I serve statically. This has the disadvantage of not being able to handle dynamic requests, but allowed me to move forward with proof-of-concept data for the client-side work.</p>
    <p>Other issues of note:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Browser compatibility:</strong> since my end project uses the HTML5 Canvas element extensively, it only renders in browsers which support this element. According to Wikipedia, this includes newer versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera. IE support does not exist prior to IE9, although earlier versions can by supplemented with Javascript or Flash for compatibility (Canvas).</li>
      <li>Similarly, since the entire visualization is written in Javascript, it will not work in browsers that have Javascript disabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> the data is pulled in via Ajax and summarized in Javascript; although the summary JSON documents could be pulled directly and read, once it is rendered via the Canvas element and thus unavailable to screen readers. In actuality, the text in this project could have been rendered in a more accessible way--the visual effects could have been rendered in a more accessible way via DOM scripting. However, exploration of the Canvas API was a specific goal of this project.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Visualization and Results</h4>
    <p>Using the above tools, I was able to generate a visualization that follows daily subpop.com MP3 downloads from 2010/06/19 to 2010/10/13. The visualization groups titles by territory with a matched color. The size of the text is indicative of the total number of downloads of a particular file in a region, with the files downloaded in larger numbers rendered in larger text. These sizes actually relate to the square root of the number of downloads; this makes the area of the text more visually appropriate in the relative sizing between the different downloads.</p>
    <p>The numbers in the bottom left corner indicate the sum totals of downloads per region, and are also color coded to match the text of the individual downloads in that region. Again, this text is sized relative to the square root of the sum downloads.</p>
    <p>The animation is not fully interactive, but the frame rate is controllable via the "S" and "F" keys ("S" for "slower," "F" for "faster"). The direction of the animation can be controlled as well with the arrow keys, and it can be paused with the SPACE key.</p>
    <p>A live demonstration of the visualization is available online here:</p>
