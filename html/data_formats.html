    <h1>Visualization of Digital Asset Consumption Data with HTML5 and Other Web Technologies</h1>
    <h2>DXARTS 511: Fall 2010, Dean Hudson</h2>
    <h3>Data Formats</h3>
    <h4>Individual Download Record Format</h4>
    <p>Download data was pulled from the disparate sources and normalized in the following JSON format:</p>
    <pre>
    {
      "referrer": {
        "url":"-",
        "host_ip":null,"host":"-"
      },
      "release":"Happy Birthday",
      "title":"Girls FM",
      "artist":"Happy Birthday",
      "format":"mp3",
      "source":"s3",
      "date":"2010-01-13",
      "request_location": {
        "city":null,
        "country_code":"US",
        "state":null,
        "lat":null,
        "lng":null
      },
      "time":"23:01:53"
    }
    </pre>
    <h4>Summary Data Format</h4>
    <p>For the purposes of the specific visual approach used in this project, individual download records were reduced into summary JSON files which summarized per track downloads by date:</p>
    <pre>
    [
      {
        "2009-06-19":
        {
          "Chad VanGaalen | City of Electric Light": 3,
          "Fleet Foxes | Mykonos": 4,
          "Fruit Bats | My Unusual Friend": 7,
          "Grand Archives | Silver Among the Gold": 12,
          "Handsome Furs | Radio Kaliningrad": 5,
          "Pissed Jeans | False Jesii Part 2": 6,
          "Tiny Vipers | Dreamer": 5,
          "Vetiver | Strictly Rule": 5
        }
      },
      {
        "2009-06-20":
        {
          "A Frames | Experiment": 5,
          "A Frames | Galena": 3,
          "Arlo | Culture": 3,
          "Arlo | Runaround": 2,
          "Band of Horses | No One's Gonna Love You": 23,
          "Band of Horses | The Funeral": 19,
          "Band of Horses | The Great Salt Lake": 9,
          "Beachwood Sparks | Confusion Is Nothing New": 2,
          "Beachwood Sparks | Drinkswater": 2,"Blitzen Trapper | Furr": 6
        }
      }
    ]
    </pre>
    <p>These files where split into individual JSON files based on the country code od the referring IP address. The above, for example, was exceerpted from date_artist_title.US.json, the summary file for US downloads.</p>
